I excel in both teaching and industry. I balance my role as a lecturer at DHBW Ravensburg with a system architect position at ZF Friedrichshafen AG, a leader in automotive technology. My expertise spans mobile/optical communication and cutting-edge autonomous vehicle systems. 
I boast a strong background in engineering, with a Ph.D. in Optical Communication Engineering and over 10 years of experience in the mobile communications sector.  
I further demonstrate my adaptability by bringing 6 years of expertise in embedded system architecture for autonomous cars.
