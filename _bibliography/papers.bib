  title={A Review on Deep Learning Autoencoder in the Design of Next-Generation Communication Systems},
  author={Alnaseri, Omar and Alzubaidi, Laith and Himeur, Yassine and Timmermann, Jens},
  abstract={Traditional mathematical models used in designing next-generation communication systems often fall short due to inherent simplifications, narrow scope, and computational limitations. In recent years, the incorporation of deep learning (DL) methodologies into communication systems has made significant progress in system design and performance optimisation. Autoencoders (AEs) have become essential, enabling end-to-end learning that allows for the combined optimisation of transmitters and receivers. Consequently, AEs offer a data-driven methodology capable of bridging the gap between theoretical models and real-world complexities. The paper presents a comprehensive survey of the application of AEs within communication systems, with a particular focus on their architectures, associated challenges, and future directions. We examine 120 recent studies across wireless, optical, semantic, and quantum communication fields, categorising them according to transceiver design, channel modelling, digital signal processing, and computational complexity. This paper further examines the challenges encountered in the implementation of AEs, including the need for extensive training data, the risk of overfitting, and the requirement for differentiable channel models. Through data-driven approaches, AEs provide robust solutions for end-to-end system optimisation, surpassing traditional mathematical models confined by simplifying assumptions. This paper also summarises the computational complexity associated with AE-based systems by conducting an in-depth analysis employing the metric of floating-point operations per second (FLOPS). This analysis encompasses the evaluation of matrix multiplications, bias additions, and activation functions. This survey aims to establish a roadmap for future research, emphasising the transformative potential of AEs in the formulation of next-generation communication systems.},

  title={Enhancing Stability and Efficiency in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs): A Multicriteria Algorithm for Optimal Multipoint Relay Selection},
  author={Abdellaoui, Ayoub and Himeur, Yassine and Alnaseri, Omar and Atalla, Shadi and Mansoor, Wathiq and Elmhamdi, Jamal and Al-Ahmad, Hussain},
  abstract={Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are autonomous systems composed of multiple mobile nodes that communicate wirelessly without relying on any pre-established infrastructure. These networks operate in highly dynamic environments, which can compromise their ability to guarantee consistent link lifetimes, security, reliability, and overall stability. Factors such as mobility, energy availability, and security critically influence network performance. Consequently, the selection of paths and relay nodes that ensure stability, security, and extended network lifetimes is fundamental in designing routing protocols for MANETs. This selection is pivotal in maintaining robust network operations and optimizing communication efficiency. This paper introduces a sophisticated algorithm for selecting multipoint relays (MPRs) in MANETs, addressing the challenges posed by node mobility, energy constraints, and security vulnerabilities. By employing a multicriteria-weighted technique that assesses the mobility, energy levels, and trustworthiness of mobile nodes, the proposed approach enhances network stability, reachability, and longevity. The enhanced algorithm is integrated into the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR) and validated through NS3 simulations, using the Random Waypoint and ManhattanGrid mobility models. The results indicate superior performance of the enhanced algorithm over traditional OLSR, particularly in terms of packet delivery, delay reduction, and throughput in dynamic network conditions. This study not only advances the design of routing protocols for MANETs but also significantly contributes to the development of robust communication frameworks within the realm of smart mobile communications.},

  abstract = {We present in numerical simulations the robustness of subcarrier index modulation (SIM) OFDM to combat laser phase noise. The ability of using DFB lasers with SIM-OFDM in 16-QAM CO-OFDM system with 1024-point FFT has been verified. Although SIM-OFDM has lower spectral efficiency compared to the conventional CO-OFDM system, it is a good candidate for 16-QAM CO-OFDM system with 1024-point FFT which uses a DFB laser of 1 MHz linewidth. In addition, we show the tolerance of SIM-OFDM for mitigation of fiber nonlinearities in long-haul CO-OFDM system. The simulation results show a significant penalty reduction, essentially that due to SPM.},

  title={Laser Phase Noise Mitigation based on Autoencoder for End-to-end Learning of CO-OFDM Systems},
  author={Alnaseri, Omar and Al-Saedi, Ibtesam R. K. and Al-Asadi, Ahmed},
  abstract = {This paper proposes an end-to-end learning approach for coherent optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (CO-OFDM) fiber communication transmission to mitigate laser phase noise. The approach is based on the autoencoder (AE) concept, which is a type of deep neural network designed to learn how to reconstruct input data at its output. In the proposed approach, the encoder component of the autoencoder generates robust symbol sequence representations for incoming data, ensuring resilience to laser phase noise impairments. The proposed approach exhibits impressive tolerance to laser phase noise of low-cost distributed feedback (DFB) lasers (a linewidth of above 1 MHz), making it effective in compensating for the impact of inter-carrier interference (ICI) phase noise within an OFDM symbol.},

Therefore, we proposed to combine the RFP with the partial carrier filling (PCF) technique that is effective in combatting SPM effects, for mitigation of both XPM and SPM. The simulated transmission over 1120 km show an improvement in Q-factor by 2 dB at 0 dBm launch power when the PCF and the RFP techniques are employed together. Various subcarrier filling schemes have been studied for the PCF technique.},
