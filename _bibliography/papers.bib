  title={The robustness of subcarrier-index modulation in 16-QAM CO-OFDM system with 1024-point FFT},
  author={Omar H. A. Jan and David Sandel and Kidsanapong Puntsri and Ali Al-Bermani and Mohamed El-Darawy and Reinhold No\'{e}},
  abstract = {We present in numerical simulations the robustness of subcarrier index modulation (SIM) OFDM to combat laser phase noise. The ability of using DFB lasers with SIM-OFDM in 16-QAM CO-OFDM system with 1024-point FFT has been verified. Although SIM-OFDM has lower spectral efficiency compared to the conventional CO-OFDM system, it is a good candidate for 16-QAM CO-OFDM system with 1024-point FFT which uses a DFB laser of 1 MHz linewidth. In addition, we show the tolerance of SIM-OFDM for mitigation of fiber nonlinearities in long-haul CO-OFDM system. The simulation results show a significant penalty reduction, essentially that due to SPM.},

  title={Laser Phase Noise Mitigation based on Autoencoder for End-to-end Learning of CO-OFDM Systems},
  author={Alnaseri, Omar and Al-Saedi, Ibtesam R. K. and Al-Asadi, Ahmed},
  abstract = {This paper proposes an end-to-end learning approach for coherent optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (CO-OFDM) fiber communication transmission to mitigate laser phase noise. The approach is based on the autoencoder (AE) concept, which is a type of deep neural network designed to learn how to reconstruct input data at its output. In the proposed approach, the encoder component of the autoencoder generates robust symbol sequence representations for incoming data, ensuring resilience to laser phase noise impairments. The proposed approach exhibits impressive tolerance to laser phase noise of low-cost distributed feedback (DFB) lasers (a linewidth of above 1 MHz), making it effective in compensating for the impact of inter-carrier interference (ICI) phase noise within an OFDM symbol.},

  abstract={We verify that the RF pilot (RFP) technique in Coherent optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (COOFDM) systems can efficiently mitigate the fiber nonlinearity induced by self-phase modulation (SPM) but not that by self-phase modulation (SPM). Therefore, we proposed to combine the RFP with the partial carrier filling (PCF) technique that is effective in combatting SPM effects, for mitigation of both XPM and SPM. The simulated transmission over 1120 km show an improvement in Q-factor by 2 dB at 0 dBm launch power when the PCF and the RFP techniques are employed together. Various subcarrier filling schemes have been studied for the PCF technique.},

  abstract={The effects of fiber nonlinearity in Coherent Optical Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (CO-OFDM) transmission, such as self-phase modulation (SPM) and cross-phase modulation (XPM), are a major concern. In this paper, we investigate the use of RF-Pilot (RFP) based nonlinearity compensation scheme in frequency domain to compensate for fiber nonlinearity in a coherent OFDM optical system. It shows that the RFP-based compensation scheme has superiority over a conventional pilot-based compensation scheme at FEC threshold. },
