  title={The robustness of subcarrier-index modulation in 16-QAM CO-OFDM system with 1024-point FFT},

  abstract = {We present in numerical simulations the robustness of subcarrier index modulation (SIM) OFDM to combat laser phase noise. The ability of using DFB lasers with SIM-OFDM in 16-QAM CO-OFDM system with 1024-point FFT has been verified. Although SIM-OFDM has lower spectral efficiency compared to the conventional CO-OFDM system, it is a good candidate for 16-QAM CO-OFDM system with 1024-point FFT which uses a DFB laser of 1 MHz linewidth. In addition, we show the tolerance of SIM-OFDM for mitigation of fiber nonlinearities in long-haul CO-OFDM system. The simulation results show a significant penalty reduction, essentially that due to SPM.},

  title={Laser Phase Noise Mitigation based on Autoencoder for End-to-end Learning of CO-OFDM Systems},
  author={Alnaseri, Omar and Al-Saedi, Ibtesam R. K. and Al-Asadi, Ahmed},
  abstract = {This paper proposes an end-to-end learning approach for coherent optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (CO-OFDM) fiber communication transmission to mitigate laser phase noise. The approach is based on the autoencoder (AE) concept, which is a type of deep neural network designed to learn how to reconstruct input data at its output. In the proposed approach, the encoder component of the autoencoder generates robust symbol sequence representations for incoming data, ensuring resilience to laser phase noise impairments. The proposed approach exhibits impressive tolerance to laser phase noise of low-cost distributed feedback (DFB) lasers (a linewidth of above 1 MHz), making it effective in compensating for the impact of inter-carrier interference (ICI) phase noise within an OFDM symbol.},
