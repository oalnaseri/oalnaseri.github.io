  abstract = {We present in numerical simulations the robustness of subcarrier index modulation (SIM) OFDM to combat laser phase noise. The ability of using DFB lasers with SIM-OFDM in 16-QAM CO-OFDM system with 1024-point FFT has been verified. Although SIM-OFDM has lower spectral efficiency compared to the conventional CO-OFDM system, it is a good candidate for 16-QAM CO-OFDM system with 1024-point FFT which uses a DFB laser of 1 MHz linewidth. In addition, we show the tolerance of SIM-OFDM for mitigation of fiber nonlinearities in long-haul CO-OFDM system. The simulation results show a significant penalty reduction, essentially that due to SPM.}
